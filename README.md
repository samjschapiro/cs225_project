# Github Organization
You should describe the physical location of all major files and deliverables (code, tests, data, the written report, the presentation video, etcâ€¦)
Our GitHub repo has seven main folders:
- **admin**: contains our team contract and project proposal
- **build**: contains the Makefile and other cmake files
- **data**: contains the datasets `airports.dat` and `routes.dat`
- **entry**: contains `main.cpp`
- **lib**: contains `cs225/` and `lodepng/`
- **src**: contains the code for all our algorithms
- **tests**: stores our test cases for each algorithm and the flight parsing

Our written report is in the main directory, titled `results.md`, and our presentation video is also located in the main directory, titled *blank*.

# Running Instructions
## You should provide full instructions on how to build and run your executable, including how to define the input data and output location for each method. 
## You should also have instructions on how to build and run your test suite, including a general description on what tests you have created.
