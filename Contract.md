# Team Contract

## Communication
1. **Team Meetings**: We will meet once a week to share our progress with each other and determine what our next steps will be before our next team meeting. We will also be asking each other for help if we have any blockers during these team meetings. The time of the meetings will be every Monday at 5pm.

2. **Assistance**: We have a groupchat on iMessage for us all to communicate. We are all expected to check it at least once a day, so we should be expected to respond in <24 hours.

3. **Respect** : We will always treat each other with curteousy and develop a team culture in which the expression of ideas is encouraged. To do this, we will never insult each other and only offer constructive criticism when we disagree.

## Collaboration

4. **Work Distribution**: Each member will share equal workload and responsibility for that workload. For those who are better at analysis and planning, they will focus on that, while others focus more on core programming. 

5. **Time Commitment**:  Each group member is expected to work 3-5 hours on the project each week. We are all heavily involved in extracurriculars, so we will be flexible if one/multiple group member(s) is/are very busy one week. When these busy weeks occur, the person or people who will be busier will need to let us know in advance in our iMessage group chat so we can work around the conflicts.

6. **Conflict Resolution**: If any conflict/disagreement arises, we will take a  vote on the situation. We'll end up going wih the side that gets the majority of the votes.
